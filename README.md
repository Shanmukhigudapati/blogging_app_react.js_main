Blogging App – React + Vite
This project provides a minimal and scalable setup to build a Blogging Application using React.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, with support for HMR and ESLint configuration.

Currently, two official plugins are available for React with Vite:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh

🔧 Features
⚛️ Built with React.js for dynamic UI

⚡ Powered by Vite for fast development and build times

🎨 Styled using Tailwind CSS

🔥 Supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

🧹 Includes ESLint for code quality
