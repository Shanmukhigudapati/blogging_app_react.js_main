# Blogging App – React + Vite

This project provides a minimal setup to build a blogging application using React and Vite, with support for Hot Module Replacement (HMR), Tailwind CSS for styling, and ESLint for code quality.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh  
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
